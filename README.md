# Getting Started With C++

This is going to be an installation guide for getting started with C++!

**Topics Covered**

1.[Installation](#install)

2.[Running Your Code](#runcode)

There are so many ways to C++ on your machine. C++ is different than Python in the sense that there may not always be a built in compiler inside of your code editor.

If you choose to use XCode or VSCode, you can run your code inside of your code editor. Or, you could use an external terminal to do so. C++ is compiled differently than a higher level programming language such as Python. This is a little difficult to grasp if your first language is Python, however, once you are comfortable with how to test your code, everything else comes very naturally *(that's pretty much the case with every programming language)*!
